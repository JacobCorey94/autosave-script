# Automatic Saving Script

## Requirements (All Platforms)

* python 3.x
* pip (to install SendKeys)
* SendKeys python library

## Requirements (Windows)
* Download the .exe!

## What this script is

Automatically saves your work by auto-typing "CTRL-S" every 5 minutes.
Made this to fool around with the SendKeys library. Works exactly as advertised.

## Why I would want this

You probably don't. This is simply a personal proof-of-concept that I
almost refrained from uploading in the first place. It's honestly
probably not worth your time if you are at all familiar with python.

If you aren't, however, feel free to download and use.
